2025-10-10 14:30:15 [INFO] Azure token obtained successfully
2025-10-10 14:30:16 [INFO] Loaded 187 voices from eastus datacenter
2025-10-10 14:30:45 [INFO] Generated: welcome_message (en-US-SaraNeural)
2025-10-10 14:30:47 [ERROR] Rate limit exceeded, retrying in 1 second
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Azure-Specific Issues

### Authentication Errors

#### "Invalid subscription key" (401 Error)
**Causes**:
- Incorrect API key
- Key for wrong service type
- Expired or deactivated key

**Solutions**:
1. Verify key in Azure Portal ‚Üí Resource ‚Üí Keys and Endpoint
2. Ensure you're using Key1 or Key2 (not endpoint URL)
3. Check service isn't suspended due to billing issues

#### "Access denied" (403 Error)
**Causes**:
- Insufficient quota
- Billing issues
- Service disabled

**Solutions**:
1. Check quota in Azure Portal
2. Verify billing information is current
3. Confirm service tier supports requested features

### Regional Issues

#### "Region mismatch" errors
**Cause**: API key region doesn't match selected datacenter

**Solution**: Ensure datacenter selection matches resource location:
```powershell
# Check resource location in PowerShell
Get-AzCognitiveServicesAccount -ResourceGroupName "your-rg" -Name "your-resource"
```

#### High latency or timeouts
**Solutions**:
1. Switch to closer datacenter
2. Check internet connection stability
3. Contact Azure support if persistent

### Voice Loading Issues

#### "No voices available"
**Causes**:
- Network connectivity issues
- Invalid authentication
- Service outage

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Test manual API call:
```powershell
$headers = @{"Authorization"="Bearer $token"}
$uri = "https://eastus.tts.speech.microsoft.com/cognitiveservices/voices/list"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -Headers $headers
```

2. Check Azure Service Health dashboard
3. Try different datacenter region

## üí° Best Practices

### Production Deployment

1. **Use Standard Tier**: Free tier has limitations unsuitable for production
2. **Implement Retry Logic**: Handle transient failures gracefully  
3. **Cache Tokens**: Tokens are valid for 10 minutes, reuse when possible
4. **Monitor Quotas**: Set up alerts before hitting limits
5. **Multiple Keys**: Use key rotation for zero-downtime updates

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Requests**: Group multiple TTS requests when possible
2. **Regional Deployment**: Use multiple regions for global applications
3. **Caching**: Cache generated audio for repeated content
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections for multiple requests

### Security Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Use Azure Key Vault in production
2. **Network Security**: Implement firewall rules and VPN access
3. **Audit Logging**: Enable diagnostic logging for compliance
4. **Data Residency**: Consider region for data sovereignty requirements
