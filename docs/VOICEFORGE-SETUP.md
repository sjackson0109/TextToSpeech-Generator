## üìã Technical Implementation Notes

### For Developers

When VoiceForge TTS is implemented, it will include:

```powershell
# Planned function structure
function Invoke-VoiceForgeTTS {
    param(
        [string]$Text,
        [string]$APIKey,
        [string]$Endpoint,
        [string]$Voice,
        [string]$Quality,
        [string]$OutputPath,
        [hashtable]$AdvancedOptions
    )
    
    # Build request
    $request = @{
        text = $Text
        voice_id = $Voice
        quality = $Quality
        format = "mp3"
        sample_rate = 22050
    }
    
    # API call with authentication
    $headers = @{
        "Authorization" = "Bearer $APIKey"
        "Content-Type" = "application/json"
    }
    
    $response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "$Endpoint/synthesize" -Method POST -Headers $headers -Body ($request | ConvertTo-Json)
    
    # Save audio file
    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($OutputPath, [Convert]::FromBase64String($response.audio_data))
}
```

### Integration Challenges
- **Custom Voice API**: Complex voice selection and management
