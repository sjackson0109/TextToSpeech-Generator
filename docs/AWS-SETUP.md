function Invoke-PollyTTS {
    # Full AWS Polly API implementation
    # Creates actual MP3/WAV audio files using AWS Polly service
    
    $audioData = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $pollyEndpoint -Method POST -Body $requestBody -Headers $headers
    [System.IO.File]::WriteAllBytes($OutputPath, $audioData)
    
    return @{ Success = $true; Message = "Generated successfully"; FileSize = $audioData.Length }
}
```

**Result**: Files are created as actual audio with high-quality AWS Polly speech synthesis.
