## üéØ Tips for Success

### ‚úÖ Do This
- **Start small**: Test with single scripts first
- **Use simple text**: Avoid special characters initially  
- **Check permissions**: Ensure you can write to output folder
- **Monitor logs**: Watch for any error messages
- **Save config**: Use Ctrl+S to save your settings

### ‚ùå Avoid This
- **Don't use system folders**: Avoid C:\Windows for output
- **Don't skip validation**: Always test your CSV format
- **Don't ignore errors**: Check logs if something fails
- **Don't use very long text**: Keep under 200 characters initially

## üîß Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **F5** | Generate audio |
| **Ctrl+R** | Generate audio (alternative) |
| **Ctrl+S** | Save configuration |
| **Ctrl+O** | Open input file |
| **Escape** | Clear log window |

## üÜò Quick Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"
- ‚úÖ Check API key is correct (no extra spaces)
- ‚úÖ Verify datacenter region matches your subscription
- ‚úÖ Ensure internet connection is working

### "CSV validation failed" 
- ‚úÖ Check file has SCRIPT and FILENAME columns (case-sensitive)
- ‚úÖ Ensure no empty rows
- ‚úÖ Use quotes around text with commas

### "No write permissions"
- ‚úÖ Try Desktop or Documents folder instead
- ‚úÖ Run PowerShell as Administrator if needed
- ‚úÖ Check folder isn't read-only

### "No voices found"
- ‚úÖ Wait a moment for voices to load after entering API key
- ‚úÖ Try different datacenter region
- ‚úÖ Check API subscription is active

## üìö Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:

1. **Read the full README.md** for comprehensive features
2. **Check docs/API-SETUP.md** for advanced API configuration
3. **Explore docs/CSV-FORMAT.md** for complex CSV formatting
4. **Review docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md** for detailed problem solving

## üéµ Sample Voice Scripts

Try these for testing different voice styles:

**Professional Announcements**:
```csv
SCRIPT,FILENAME
"Welcome to TechCorp. Your call is important to us.","corporate_welcome"
"Thank you for your patience. A representative will be with you shortly.","professional_hold"
"Your transaction has been completed successfully.","transaction_success"
```

**Friendly Greetings**:
```csv
SCRIPT,FILENAME
"Hi there! Thanks for calling. How can I help you today?","friendly_greeting"
"Have a wonderful day and thank you for choosing us!","cheerful_goodbye"
"Great news! Your order is ready for pickup.","positive_update"
```

**Emergency Messages**:
```csv
SCRIPT,FILENAME
"Attention: This is an important system announcement.","urgent_attention"
"Please exit the building in an orderly fashion.","evacuation_notice"
"System maintenance in progress. Please try again later.","maintenance_alert"
```

## üèÜ Pro Tips

### Maximize Quality
- **Use punctuation**: Periods and commas create natural pauses
- **Spell out numbers**: "Twenty-five" sounds better than "25"
- **Avoid abbreviations**: "Doctor" instead of "Dr."
- **Test different voices**: Each has unique characteristics

### Boost Productivity  
- **Save templates**: Keep common CSV formats ready
- **Use keyboard shortcuts**: Much faster than clicking
- **Batch similar content**: Group by voice or style
- **Enable secure storage**: No need to re-enter API keys

### Enterprise Usage
- **Monitor quotas**: Check API usage regularly
- **Implement approval workflow**: Review scripts before generation
- **Standardize naming**: Use consistent filename conventions
- **Archive outputs**: Keep organized folders by date/project
